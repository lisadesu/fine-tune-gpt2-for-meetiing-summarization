They did they took the blueprints from the yellowboard.," Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions ,
 uh like just th the channels uh one till nine ,
 Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .
 I think that's just basic what we need .
 Mm-hmm .
 Uh
 Yes .
 I haven't really found a conclusion like that .
 yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .
 Yeah .
 Design ."
"The marketing expert presented research on the topic, and was pleased with the result."," So our design looks something like this .
 This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
 so that's just"
"The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meetings
and gave a timeline for the project."," Okay .
 I totally
 Yeah
 'cause I moved it .
 Yeah .
 So uh
 and
 Okay .
 I don't know .
 Yeah
 So um
 I E that had a vaguely non-remote like shape"
The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls.," I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself ,
 You have to set them , reset them to everything .
 Um and that would only add buttons .
 They're just simple T V remote controls .
 But one is uh user-centred .
 And you can straight away see there's less buttons .
 Um and finally , um uh"
The Project Manager discussed the project finances with the aim of selling prices.," and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um ,
 we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros
 and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent .
 we're looking at making it at a very good price .
 Um , okay , um"
"The group discussed the project process before it started,
process, creativity, and then the creativity time.", Okay . Groovy .
The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point., So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
They should be able to use the features that are standard.," Three .
 Three .
 This one ?"
"The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface, the Industrial Designer to research the working design, and the Marketing Expert to prepare a user requirement specification."," Or not present but bring to the meeting .
 Industrial Designer .
 Industrial Designer ."
The industrial designer presented a prototype to the product.," Um how uh how we doing ?
 Yeah , good .
 Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
 Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working ,
 Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm ."
"They close the meeting upon establishing what.
They close at the time of their meeting."," Um the costs are within the budget ,
 we evaluated the project ,
 and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so .
 Alright , thank you team ,
 Yay .
 Thanks to the Project Leader .
 Now we know w"
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete.," And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements ,
 Stam .
 Yeah .
 I think we should now all go work uh uh at this
 Yeah .
 Okay ."
The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would be absolutely necessary for the remote.," Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions ,
 And also you need a sender for location signal ,
 um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb
 And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T V which would output some sort of signal ,
 and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .
 Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source ,
 and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself ."

 Tool training
 I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training ."
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meetings.," we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes .
 I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out .
 Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck ,
 and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .
 Um that pretty much sums up the last one .
 we'll just crack on ,
 Um uh the con today is the concep today .
 and is um"
The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit.," Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro ,"
"The industrial designer discussed his options on the options for the remote, and decided on a sample design."," but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours ,
 v line thing may be something we can look into .
 
 So
 I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
 Um .
 I d
 I like the idea of of rubber too
 'Cause so many
 Yeah , it's like , yep
 it's ubiquitous
 isn't it ?
 
 "
The project manager opened the meeting and recapped the minutes of the previous meeting.," Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found .
 I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me .
 Um room for creativity ?"
"The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project, including a new function requirement for the remote and a new product requirements specification."," And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found
 and then we'll have a bit of discussion .
 So basically uh
 I dunno if you guys got this email as well

The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting.," Thank you very much indeed ,"
The Project Manager discussed the projected profit aim and price point.," We're gonna talk about project finances .
 and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range ,
 Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro ."
The Project Manager went over decisions from here and there about the remote.," Do you wanna put your cord back in ?
 I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements .
 Um the remote's only gonna be for the television ,
 So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem .
 And our corporate colours are grey and yellow .
 And we could probably get away with black too but
 So those are the three um the three new requirements
 that that I was told we need to use ."
The project manager recapped the events of the meeting.," Um , so let's try the whiteboard .
 Uh .
 That's it .
