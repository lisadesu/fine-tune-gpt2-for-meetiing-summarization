""Generally, generally, uh, this remote control, uh, should be something, in my opinion, uh, the first feature is just to be easy to use. So the more frequent buttons should be larger, they should be placed in a good position inside the remote control. And I can conclude like this, that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it. It should be we shouldn't need to open a book and start reading and learning how to use this remote control.""
""Okay. So what I found out that, as I said, I think it's better to put more frequent buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control, and they should be bigger in size. The shape of the remote control should be in a way which can be taken easily in hand. It should not be completely like a cube. It should be it should have round edges, so then it's easier. And maybe, just like some toys, some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand.""
""And also, uh, I think if we put some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier. Not on the remote control. I dunno if I can explain well. But just inside. For example, a sliding or rolling stuff, if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with thumb. So it can be another preference."""
