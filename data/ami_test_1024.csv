The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included.,"Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions ,
uh like just th the channels uh one till nine ,
uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that .
Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel .
and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .

The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers.,"So our design looks something like this .
This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable .
So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable ,","ID: Okay
ID: well um .
ID: So our design looks something like this .
ID: This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever .
ID: This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu .

ID: So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever .
ID: And it comes
ID: yeah , I can change the vegetable .
ID: This one's broccoli .
ID: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want .
ID: This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .

PM: Oh is that broccoli ?
UI: Yeah .
ID: This is a mango .
ID: The
ID: it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits .
ID: You don't have orange , you have mango .
ID: Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but
ME: 
PM: 
PM: 'S a very bright strawberry .
ID: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .

ID: And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
PM: 
ID: Mm-hmm .
PM: Oh yeah .
UI: It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable ,
UI: and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big .
UI: Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay
UI: and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow .
UI: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator .
UI: How how so
PM: Oh yeah .
ID: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
UI: Okay
UI: so that's just
ID: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere
UI: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the
ID: Yeah
ID: we didn't design that .
UI: Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed .
ID: But it would be coordinating with that of course .

"The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen, to hide the complicated features, and to start building the prototype).","here we have our detailed design meeting
where we will um look at the prototype

It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .
um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting ,
basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here
and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition ,
I E that had a vaguely non-remote like shape
um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote
since you could just use your voice .

"The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote, presented two differently designed remotes available on the market, and described some features a user-centered remote should include.","You have to set them , reset them to everything .

The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use.,"Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use .
And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .
they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control .
So , the more frequent buttons should be larger ,
Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand .
And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .
so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels ,
Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .
And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good .
but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .","PM: Um . Number ?
PM: Three .
UI: Yeah .
UI: Three .
PM: This one ?
UI: 
PM: 
UI: Yes .
UI: Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second .
UI: Uh , n n no , it's the first one .
UI: The second one .
PM: So it's not this one .
UI: Uh yeah .
UI: Okay .
UI: 
UI: Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use .
UI: So , the more frequent buttons should be larger ,
UI: they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control .
UI: And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it .
UI: It should be
UI: we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control .
UI: Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size .
UI: Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand .
UI: It should not be completely like uh a cube .
UI: It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier .
UI: And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand .
UI: And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .
ID: Exactly .
UI: Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places
UI: and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone .
UI: Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part ,
UI: so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels ,
UI: and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control .
UI: And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this .
UI: Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier .
UI: Not on remote control .
UI: I dunno if I can explain well .
UI: But uh just inside .
UI: For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb .
UI: So it can be another uh preference .
UI: And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good .
UI: I know that it consumes lots of energy ,
UI: but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy .
UI: And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new .
UI: So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it ."

PM: Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less .
PM: Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working ,
PM: meaning gathering i suggestions
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given .
PM: Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
PM: Um it's also an item that people lose a lot .
PM: So we should address that .
PM: And , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use .
ME: 
PM: In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive ,
PM: or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
PM: so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact ,
PM: 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work .
PM: Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve .
PM: And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .
ID: Hmm .
PM: Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip
ME: 
PM: that has infra-red bits
PM: and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip .
PM: Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner .
PM: There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed ,
PM: mm uh uh child lock
PM: um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch .
PM: Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes .
PM: So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires ,
PM: and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item .
PM: Francino who is our um
PM: interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button ,
PM: and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock .
UI: Interface designer .
PM: Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable .
PM: It should be compact .
PM: Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped .
PM: And maybe have an anar alarm-clock .
PM: And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature .
PM: Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves .
PM: Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .
ME: 
PM: And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .
UI: Yes .
PM: Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ?
PM: Okay .
ID: Yeah .
UI: Yes .
ME: Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm .
PM: Okay ,

"The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together, and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used.","Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions ,
the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T V .
And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T V and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote ,
processor to take the information ,
and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration .
Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source ,
um a button pad for input ,
I R transmitter to communicate to the T V ,

ID: which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T V or stick it on their wall .
ID: And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works .
ID: Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip ,
ID: um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb
ID: which is probably the easiest way to send to the T V .
ID: And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T V which would output some sort of signal ,
ID: um we could use I R but we'd probably wanna use radio instead .
ID: That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it ,
ID: and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .
ID: Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source ,
ID: that way you wouldn't have to plug it in ,
ID: um a button pad for input ,
ID: um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff ,
ID: I R transmitter to communicate to the T V ,
ID: that's just sort of standard , um so most T V s have an I R receiver .
ID: Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it
ID: and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself ."
They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete.,"we've got like five minutes left .
but if we've finished , then we've finished .
Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it .
Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?

The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting.,"I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out .
Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , L C D and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons .
Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck ,
and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck .","PM: Alright , yeah .

PM: So
PM: we'll just crack on ,
PM: um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible .
PM: Um uh the con today is the concep today .
PM: This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase

"The Project Manager then presented the project budget to the group and presented the projected profit aim, the production cost, and the price point of the device.","Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro ,

The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt.,"but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours ,
like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,
Different skin options ,
and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy ,
though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh
not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something
As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case ,
it has a consistency of those stress balls .
I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
