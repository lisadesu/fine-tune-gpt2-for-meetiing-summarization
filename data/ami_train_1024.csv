It's not a directional mic , anyway .
So I will try to get my presentation running .
Can't help you with that .

It's working .","UI: Okay .
ID: Or you get it .
ID: Okay .
UI: No I don't think so
UI: it has to be like that
UI: yeah
UI: and you have to adjust the length .
UI: Okay , and then .
PM: So

PM: Somewhere .
ME: Okay . Mm .
PM: So ,
PM: good morning , everyone .
PM: Um
ID: 
PM: Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project .
PM: I hope you all have been uh updated about it .
ID: Yeah .
PM: Good .
UI: So . Yes ."
The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design.,"Prototype presentation , well first","PM: Can I close this ?
UI: Uh we don't have any changes ,
UI: do we ?
UI: So no .
PM: Oh , okay .
UI: 
PM: 
PM: There we go .
PM: Okay ,
PM: here we are again .
PM: Detailed design
PM: oh , come on .
PM: Well Ah
PM: s
PM: Forgot to insert the minutes ,
PM: but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh
PM: Could open that anyway , think .
PM: Other design
PM: anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time .
PM: We also that you're just busy with it .
PM: Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features .
PM: Well ,
PM: we discussed the design ,
PM: no sharp corners , we rounded it off ,
PM: like you see on the other screen ,
PM: which is fine .
PM: Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black .
PM: Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway .
PM: So
PM: then we ca
PM: yeah .
PM: We agreed that we would implement both the L C D and speech recognition ,
PM: but I'll get to that in a moment .
PM: 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway .
PM: So so ,
PM: like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices ,
PM: but we have 'em now ,
ME: Hmm .
PM: and it's bad .
PM: Anyway .
PM: We are
PM: Oh .
PM: Prototype presentation , well first
PM: you guys built the prototype .
PM: So
PM: you could could present that .
PM: But um let's see what be handy to do .
PM: Nee no ,
PM: you just go ahead and present
PM: the w
PM: we'll scrap it later
PM: because
ID: I think it's more or less the same as we had .
PM: What ?
UI: It's basically what we agreed upon ,
UI: but just a little bit more specified .
ME: Hmm ?
PM: Oh
PM: that's
ID: No much s
PM: hasn't changed that much , huh ?
PM: I didn't expect anyway .
PM: You just coloured it .
ID: No no no , not at all .
UI: Uh s
UI: Final design .
UI: Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components ,
UI: as you can see right over here .
UI: We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow
UI: so that it com really shows in this keypad .
UI: If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast .
UI: So
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: I like the menu .
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose .
PM: I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to
UI: Probab
UI: Yeah .
UI: That's the be
ID: Hmm .
UI: And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber
UI: than to uh
ID: Yeah , of course .
ME: Mm yeah .
ID: That's uh the integration story again .
ME: Okay .
UI: So we have it's a bit round shaped ,
UI: that's what we had
UI: uh
PM: Oh yeah .
UI: We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute .
UI: So that's basically what we chose there .
UI: If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: Okay .
ID: No , uh
ID: this is just a description of what we see there .
ID: So
PM: Yeah .
UI: Oh .
ME: Yeah .
ID: Speaks for itself .
UI: That's pretty much it ."
The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design.,"W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit ,
I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
I was really thinking a lot about the I uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .","ID: W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit ,
ID: because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .
UI: Yeah , maybe .
UI: Or
PM: Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?
UI: I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
PM: Okay ,
PM: we'll move the
UI: Um
ID: 
UI: You can even have them in different flavours as well .
UI: So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour ,
UI: yeah . Scratch and sniff .
ME: Yeah .
ME: Or s or smelly . Scratchy
ME: Uh well
ME: I was really thinking a lot about the I uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone .
ME: It's hot on the streets , guys ."
"They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries.","And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .","PM: Right , I think we have to round it up , um
ME: Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything .
ME: So it's no teletext ,
ME: it's only for T V and by implication video ,
ME: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control ,
ME: um something about Videoplus .
PM: Sure .
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
ME: Right .
ME: Right .
ME: Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L C D , a reminder about using Videoplus ?
ME: So that they have a look at the guide and
ME: Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements ,
ME: is this just that was an add-on feature ?
PM: It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that .
PM: Um it could be it c
ME: Uh-huh .
ME: Right .
ME: Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ?
ME: Right .
PM: It
PM: yes ,
PM: it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature ,
PM: you know , drawing attention to that .
ID: Yeah .
PM: And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual ,
PM: 'cause it's very simple
PM: so putting it down in words should be helpful .
ME: Mm , and the rechargeable batteries .
ME: Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ?
PM: Yeah .
PM: Um
UI: Yeah .
PM: We've got the buttons
PM: but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .
UI: Yeah .
ME: Mm-hmm .
ME: That's not at the moment a requirement ,
ME: it's something we're looking at ,
ME: what preference
ME: so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
PM: Yes . Yes .
PM: And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .
UI: For detection , right .
ID: Yeah .
PM: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible .
PM: But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it
PM: so it should be fine
PM: and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .
PM: I think
PM: Yep ,
PM: and different from what's out there .
PM: Yep , I think that's us .
UI: Yep ,
UI: I think
ME: Okay .
ME: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ?
ME: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?
UI: True .
ID: Okay .
PM: I think you might get guidance ,
PM: but um
PM: I th
PM: Instruction manuals ,
PM: 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,
ME: Okay .
PM: 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing ,
PM: u um , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them ,
PM: but no one really uses them .
ME: Okay .
PM: Um .
ME: Whoops , questionnaire four .
UI: Oops .
UI: We should f
PM: Yes , right . Okay .
ME: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .
UI: I think it's time for us to get back to
PM: Right , okay .
PM: I think you can email me , if there's any more questions .
PM: Um and I'll be able to not answer them ."
The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting.,"Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute .
Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the

The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions.,"And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small

Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large .

ID: But you're the expert .
ME: I think it depends on the function .
UI: Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .
PM: Mm-hmm .
UI: Maybe it
ME: Well , if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course .

PM: Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it .
PM: So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control .
PM: Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .
PM: As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company .
PM: It is in three step as you know .
PM: First the functional design .
PM: The second's a conceptual design ,
PM: and then the detailed design .
PM: During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks
PM: and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next .
PM: So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board
PM: so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings .
PM: So who want to start ?
UI: Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah .
PM: Mister ."
The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point.,"Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro
and profit aim is fifty million Euro .

How many should we sell then ?
well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .","PM: Okay .
PM: So moving on .
PM: Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro
PM: and profit aim is fifty million Euro .
PM: So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country .
PM: Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
UI: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?
PM: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
UI: Okay .
ME: How many should we sell then ?
ME: Um , a lot ,
ME: two two two million ,
ME: two mi no ,
ME: more f four million .
PM: Anyone a mathematician ?
ID: Two million .
ME: Four million .
ME: And it
ME: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .

ID: Oh , yeah .
ME: It is a lot . Uh .
PM: So f that's a fifty percent um uh ."
The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting.,"we have seen the prototype .
It's very nice according to the work of our two designer .
The the the financial aspect were okay .
We we have the cost below uh our threshold
and so we could sell at twenty five Euros
and make i make profit .
The the evaluation give satisfying result as well .
the cost is in the budget ,
the evaluation is okay ,
so I th I think we can now uh open champagne
Congratulations to the team .
Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
I think it was a good collaboration uh .","PM: So ,

The project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million Euro.,"I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal
Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .
In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each
four million . You'd have to sell four million .","ME: Uh yeah .

ME: B
ME: yeah .
ME: Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
ME: But um let me
ME: I have two thoughts .
ME: One hundred , fifty percent .
PM: Okay .
ME: And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?
PM: 
PM: Yes ,
PM: 'cause our market um is international
PM: and your problem is has to do with marketing of

ME: At twenty five .
ME: Mm-hmm .
ME: Yeah ,

The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote.,"Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements ,
which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is .
so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .
Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V C R , D V D or anything else .
I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .
So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T V .
And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say
'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it ,
'cause it's quite long .
So those are the three things ,
just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T V , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company .","PM: Is that alright now ?
PM: Okay .
PM: Sorry ?
PM: Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ?
PM: Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design .
PM: All ready to go ?
PM: Okay .
PM: Um so hopefully you've all been working away ,
PM: and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder .
PM: Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time .
PM: Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment
PM: and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s
ME: Could you plug me in ?
UI: 
ME: Okay .
ME: Thanks .
ME: Okay .
PM: Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements ,
PM: which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is .
PM: Nobody uses teletext very much anymore ,
PM: so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control .
PM: Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V C R , D V D or anything else .
PM: I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market .

ME: 'Kay .
ME: Okay .
PM: Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is .
PM: It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
ME: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
PM: Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um
PM: uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say
ME: 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
PM: Uh something
PM: Yeah ,
PM: I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it ,
PM: 'cause it's quite long .
ID: Mm yeah .
ID: Nope , we're all set .
PM: Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure .
PM: So that's something we can discuss as well .
PM: So those are the three things ,
PM: just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T V , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company .
PM: Um so is everybody okay with any of that
PM: , or do you want me to recap at all ?"

The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device.,"what I found is we want to do fashion

There's no need to have that in the remote .
um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device ,

so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
It does look very cool .
then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against .
Then I need to say some st a few things about finance ,
'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria .
Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits .

and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes ,
um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion ,
because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements
and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have .
for the minutes of the first meeting .
the product was developed uh and reviewed ,
and we talked about the financial end of it .
Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese .
Did I miss something ?
we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .
as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes .

He tells them some new project requirements given by management.,"Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this
and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought .
the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .
Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .
what is not q quite clear from their directive is
whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext
or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D V D s , um satellite boxes ,
which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise .
The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R s in grey against uh a yellow background .
this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .
Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly ,
but uh um we we need to talk that through .","PM: Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this
PM: and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought .
PM: Um and and then we'll
PM: as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out ,
PM: and we have uh forty minutes to do this in
PM: and I uh
PM: Anyway . Okay . Now ,
PM: the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet .

PM: which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise .
PM: The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
PM: Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind ,
PM: um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things .
PM: Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours .
PM: Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R s in grey against uh a yellow background .
PM: Um now
PM: this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market .
PM: But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that .
PM: Um it also has to be simple ,
PM: which to some extent goes along w with the first one ,
PM: and that we've already said that it must be simple
PM: 'cause that's what people want anyway .
PM: Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly ,
PM: which um mm uh is is is their choice ,
PM: but uh um we we need to talk that through .

The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote.,"I'm responsible for working design ,
uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control .
So we have the energy source ,
we have the user interface ,
Uh the sender will push the button ,
the chip will respond ,
Do we need uh many buttons ,
or do we need l many light bulbs
Um , the joystick is another thing ,
if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that .
you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip ,
You have the switch turn it on ,
infrared bulb , uh will contact the T V
do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs ,
Um , I dunno what we should decide on that .","PM: Right . Um ,
PM: if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .
ID: Yeah .
ID: Uh , I was still working on stuff ,
ID: I hadn't got it finished .
ID: Um , alright .
ID: Click to save in
ID: where do I have to save it ?
PM: If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents .
PM: If you save it in there we can open it up from here .
ID: Um , what I've done with it ,
ID: I'm sorry .
ID: Shit .
ID: Um
PM: Are you finding it okay
PM: or ?
ID: I'm just closing it now .
ID: where I've saved it .
ME: Well like
ME: if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working
ME: yeah ,
ME: and you just click file save as .
ID: that's it there ,
ID: yeah .
ID: Oh right .
PM: Okay .
ID: Uh , right
ID: I'm responsible for working design ,
ID: uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control .
ID: So we have the energy source ,
ID: we have the user interface ,
ID: this this is what I've seen .
ID: Uh the sender will push the button ,
ID: the chip will respond ,
ID: uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T V .
ID: So uh uh ,
ID: if you go to next slide ,
ID: you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface .
ID: Do we need uh many buttons ,
ID: or do we need l many light bulbs
ID: that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not .
ID: Um , , or would that take too much power ,
ID: would we need more um components in there to supply the power ?
ID: Um , the joystick is another thing ,
ID: if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that .
ID: Um , so uh
ID: we need to
ID: I dunno exactly what
PM: Mm-hmm .
ID: That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design ,
ID: um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface .
ID: So ,
ID: that'll be decided , I guess .
PM: Okay .
ID: Uh , and the next slide .
ID: Oh , yeah Um ,
ID: if you go to the next slide then .
ID: I just used the
ID: it was a mess ,
ID: uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh
PM: Oh .
PM: Yeah .
ME: 
PM: Ah ,
PM: don't worry about it at all mate .
ID: Uh so
ID: you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip ,
ID: and the user interface obviously contains everything .
ID: You have the switch turn it on ,
ID: infrared bulb , uh will contact the T V
ID: and will have whatever device or D V D player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on .
ID: Uh , so
ID: do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs ,
ID: would it be easier ?

PM: Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing
PM: and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro .
PM: Okay .
PM: So let's go .
PM: Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .
PM: So we went through th uh
PM: w we took this following decisions .
PM: No L C D , no speech recognition technology , okay ,
PM: we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control .
PM: We went through the use of wheels and but buttons .
PM: And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost ."
"The industrial designer reported on working design, explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components.","It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .

ID: a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world .
ID: And and the components are very uh very cheap .
ID: Um ,
ID: Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available .
ID: Uh , again , it's a fair price .
ID: It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um
ID: Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control .
ID: Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires ,
ID: it's it is uh
ID: can be made as fast as printing paper .

"The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote.","Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition ,
Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .
Simple is beautiful .
And eye-catching is important .","PM: We don't have a lot of time left
PM: and we will still have to make a decision ,
PM: and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .
ME: 
ME: Okay .
ME: Go right to my first my next slide .
PM: Uh okay .
ME: Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition ,
ME: so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers .
ME: I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing .
ME: And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have ,
ME: and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it .
ME: And I would encourage you all to do the same .
ME: Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful .
ME: Um people like something that really fits in their hand .
ME: Simple is beautiful .
ME: They don't want to have to squint at small print um ,
ME: they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible ,
ME: and they don't care for the mode thing .
ME: They want each button to do something .
ME: And eye-catching is important .
ME: It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing .
ME: Go ahead ,
ME: I'm trying to finish fast for you .
ME: Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition .
ME: Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others ,
ME: so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item .
ME: And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign .
ME: If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere .
ME: So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product .
ME: And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular .
ME: And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular .
ME: And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal .
ME: They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them .
ME: So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
UI: 'Kay .
UI: Mm-hmm .
ME: "
The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports.,"so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .
Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,
Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .
From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .","ME: Can you open my presentation ,
ME: please .
PM: 
PM: Uh .
ME: I'm number four .
ME: Trend .
ME: Yep .
PM: This one ?
PM: Turn .
ME: Can you pass the mouse ,
ME: please .
ME: Oh okay , that's fine .
ME: the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan .
ME: Um
ME: so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority .
ME: Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority .
ME: Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .
ME: Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria .
ME: Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,
ME: but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .
PM: Hmm .
ID: Hmm .
ME: From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
ME: So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category .
ME: And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .
PM: Okay .
ME: Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .
ME: Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it .
ME: Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel .
ME: And that it's easy to use
ME: and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . Um .
PM: So , Hamed , can you .
UI: Yeah . The second one .
UI: Could you please show the presentation number three .
PM: Mm-hmm ."
He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included.,"So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .
Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power .","UI: And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need ,
UI: just basically every remote'll need 'em .
UI: We need some kinda of power d power source .
UI: Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department ,
UI: but the in user interface is also a major component .
UI: Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L E D , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal .
ID: 
UI: Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L E D , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal .
UI: You need a on-off switch
UI: um I don't know how that got in there .
UI: And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T V s .
UI: So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals
UI: and so that'll require some memory as well .
UI: Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work .
UI: You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there ,
UI: and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing ,
UI: and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L E D
UI: and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor .
UI: So those are the basic components that need to go into this
UI: and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around .
ME: Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um
UI: I think any des
ME: This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here .
ME: We're talking about existing technology .
ME: Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .
UI: No .
UI: Right
UI: I think
UI: Yeah
UI: this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote .
UI: We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition ,
UI: I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip .
ME: Okay . Okay .
PM: Do we have an idea of costs of different components ?
UI: Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip
UI: and the uh th it could als
UI: basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well .
UI: Um the L E D and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap .
PM: 'Kay .
UI: So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap .
UI: Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power .
PM: Mm 'kay .
PM: Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No .
UI: Uh I don't have any figures right now .
UI: We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that .
UI: Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .
PM: 'Kay .
PM: Yeah .
ME: N okay .
ME: Mm .
ME: Mm the shell ?
UI: Yeah . Basically yeah .
ME: Okay .
PM: Okay ."

The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design.,"so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that
So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,
And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product .","PM: So but le let us see first the new requirement .
PM: So we don't have to
PM: so this this uh is uh is um in the
PM: this is in the same direction as we were speaking
PM: so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that
UI: But teletext is just one button .
PM: Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .
UI: You you just write the write the numbers .
PM: Yeah .
PM: So well
UI: So will you add with the channel keys , right ?
PM: Yeah .
PM: So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users ,
PM: they prefer to s
UI: So .
UI: 
UI: I am .
UI: I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see
UI: just one button .
PM: Yeah .
PM: I dunno .
PM: If i one button is still one more button .
PM: If if
PM: if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .
UI: So .
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: Well anyway I have this point .
PM: We can discuss .
PM: Also um so
PM: as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T V um
PM: because we want to be quick on on the market .
PM: And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product .

like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general .
I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with
Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes .","PM: Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes .
PM: I think you all
PM: did you get uh notices on your computer for this ?
PM: Okay so well , you got the notice um
PM: uh . The working design , I guess that's the function
PM: I D uh who is this ?
PM: The industrial designer That's you .
ID: Me yeah .
UI: Yes .
ID: Yeah .
ID: Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical .
PM: Okay .
PM: So , we looking for a working design when we come back .
ID: Yeah .
PM: 
ID: Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design .
PM: Then
PM: And then the technical funct you are the technical function ,
PM: so so you are the working design .
PM: So you have a working design and then a functional design .
PM: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification ,
PM: like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general .
PM: That would be your idea .
PM: And , of course , price .
PM: That it , that it , that the price is a good price .
PM: I mean , the price is given , but , that was
ID: Yeah , functional design ,
ID: and you
UI: Okay .
ME: Mm-hmm .
ME: We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
PM: That's right .
PM: That's right .
UI: 
PM: And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that .
PM: I think that's the end of the show .
PM: Yeah .
PM: So um we have
PM: well , we have a twen two two two three minutes .
PM: Um any questions at this point ?
PM: Or uh suggestions ?
ME: Mm .
PM: I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with
PM: and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh
UI: Okay .
ID: Yeah .
ME: Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting .
ME: How about you people ?
ME: Really ?
ME: Okay .
PM: Mm-hmm .
ID: Yeah , even I have .

ID: Yeah , so let's see .
PM: Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes .
PM: And see what we can come up with .

PM: Okay ?
ID: Yeah ."
The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard.,"So I've been looking at the components design .
Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard .
Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case ,
And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board ,
Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .
And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
Um , I'd recommend against titanium
Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
Uh , well we can use wood .
I don't know why we'd want to .","ID: So I've been looking at the components design .
ID: Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet
ID: and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
ID: Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard .
ID: Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case ,
ID: probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
ID: And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board ,
ID: because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time .
ID: But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .
ID: Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel .
ID: The infrared L E D is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it .
ID: Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .
ID: And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
ID: So we have some material options .
ID: Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
ID: Um , I'd recommend against titanium
ID: because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .
ID: Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
PM: And why not wood ?
PM: And why not wood ?
ID: And ,
ID: hmm ?
ID: Uh , well we can use wood .
ID: I don't know why we'd want to .
ID: Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
ID: We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
ID: I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive ."
The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team.,"Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes

"The basic functions should include an on/off switch, buttons for channels one to nine, volume, mute and buttons for next and previous channel.",three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly .,"ME: Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements .
ME: Um yes .
ME: The working method um
ME: there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab
ME: and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions .
ME: Uh , I've lined them up here .
ME: Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not ,
ME: about willingness to spend money on remote control ,
ME: about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that .
ME: I uh have found some interesting things .
ME: We do we do got a market .
ME: Um ,
ME: three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly .
ME: So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
ME: Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results .
ME: Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
ME: That's quite a lot .
ME: Um ,
ME: relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour .
ME: Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text ,
ME: and the more um , yeah ,
ME: other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used .
ME: Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
ME: That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated .
ME: Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room .
ME: And um an important thing here ,
ME: the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old .
ME: And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls ."

Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find ,
so we gonna have that locator function .
Um and we want to be different .
Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape .
Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand .","PM: Oh .

PM: Then I believe each of you have a presentation .
PM: Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote ,
PM: what they want .

The group then began a discussion about features of remote controls and their own  experiences with them.,"Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote ,","ID: Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote ,
ID: right ?
ID: One remote for everything .
PM: Right .
UI: And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T V , D V D , V H S , uh TiVo ?
ME: Right .
ID: Um .
ID: I think they'll be phasing V H S out shortly .
ME: Yeah , TiVo .
PM: TiVo .
UI: But it's still there , so
ID: Okay .
UI: if po if we're gonna do it
ME: It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .
PM: They're never universal . That's right .
PM: Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D V D player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the
PM: Yeah . Yeah .
PM: Something from Sam's club .
UI: Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know .
ID: So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .
PM: Yeah .
ME: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet ,
ME: because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .
PM: Yeah .
PM: 'Kay ,
PM: and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand .
PM: If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more .
PM: They want the ergonomic ones .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Ones that ones that look high-tech , too .
ME: They want like the flashy lights .
ME: Oh like this came from Las Vegas .
UI: But at the same time are simple .
ME: Mm yeah .
PM: Right .
PM: So that people like my mother can use it .
ID: What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?
PM: Yeah .
ID: What kinda battery would we want to use ?
ID: Because battery changing is usually
ID: Okay .
UI: D
UI: Double A .
ME: Double A .
PM: Do some of them use triple A s though ?
ME: Yeah some use triple A s .
ME: So double or triple ?
UI: Some but
PM: Okay .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: I guess then it's
UI: If we need to do triple A we can , but most people usually have double A s around .
PM: Okay . Yeah .
PM: But that has to do with the size of it too .
PM: Well , w as long as we know that issue is
UI: Right .
ID: Yeah .
ME: Yeah ,
ME: if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A .
PM: Here we can
PM: Triple A .
PM: But
PM: it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now ,
PM: just as long as we remember battery type and size is important .
PM: Hey .
PM: Anything else ?
ID: Can you with a small lithium battery ?

The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members.,"But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here .
They are smart boards .
As you can see , you can give a presentation on them .
And uh this one here is a white board .
Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder
and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .
As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here .
Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page ,
um uh to go back and forward between pages ,
Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance
Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .
it's not such a fast board ,
and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things ,
And um you can also delete an entire page ,
but we ask you not to do that .
because we want to save all the results .
And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen ,","PM: Okay .
PM: But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here .
PM: I already talked about the cameras and microphones ,
PM: but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh
PM: we will have to take advantage of these two things .

PM: like this if everything's okay ,
PM: but I first have to put it on the pen ,
PM: you see I'm new to it too .
PM: Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want .
PM: As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow ,
PM: it's not such a fast board ,
PM: it's a smart board but also a slow board .
PM: Uh but you can write things
PM: and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things ,
PM: so we have uh est left .

PM: you can erase it with the eraser ,
PM: but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page ,
PM: but just create a new blank one .
PM: I will delete this one now
PM: because we don't use it yet .
UI: Right .
ME: S
UI: Alright .
PM: But you can of course erase when you make a mistake ,
PM: but don't uh delete entire pages .
PM: And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen ,
PM: for instance take a blue one
PM: and uh change the line width like to five .

The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available.,"Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .
We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
you were sitting watching T V are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T","ME: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me ,
ME: it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .
ME: If we flip open ,
ME: now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display ,

ME: I know what you mean ,
ME: it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph

ID: we had to buy one .
ME: Right .
PM: Really ?
ME: So
PM: Mm .
ME: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price ,

ME: or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?

PM: Yeah ,
PM: um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
ID: Hmm .

PM: the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case .
PM: And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements .
PM: And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing .
PM: It's
PM: So ,
PM: let's go .
PM: First with Rama ."
The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting.,"um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes ,
We wanted a stand-by function .
The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable .
Um buttons with a combination of L C D and rubber according to the design .
Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel .
Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that .
Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R S I .","PM: If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
UI: Hmm .
ME: Is that someone's ?
PM: Is that .
UI: Thank you .
PM: three , apparently .

PM: but I don't know ,
PM: I'm not sold on this ,
PM: it's pretty dear ,
PM: I mean
PM: twenty f
PM: that's like you know forty bucks for a remote .
PM: It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me .
PM: Um so
PM: what
PM: we can maybe work on that a later
PM: but we're gonna make a lot on it ,
PM: the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .
ME: Mm .
PM: Eur internationally .
PM: So um
PM: one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .
ID: Okay .
PM: Um so
PM: something that could do N T S C as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D V D s
PM: but um you know
PM: I'll leave that to you guys
PM: but that's something that i i
PM: it is gonna be an international sold thing .

They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote.,"The weight . Not not too heavy .
Not much buttons .
That when you drop it , it won't break .
Like uh some kind of rubber on it .
Or hard uh hard plastic .
Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it .
When you push a but a button on the T V , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep .
Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh
And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material .
So probably plastic or something . Uh
Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .
on our website we can see what products we already have .
And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries .
So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .","ID: The weight . Not not too heavy .
PM: Not too heavy .
ID: Not much buttons .

PM: Yes .
UI: 
PM: Like a phone .
ME: Yeah .
PM: Okay .
ID: 
UI: Yeah .
ID: 
PM: So ,
PM: that's .
ID: Next .
UI: Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh
UI: Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um
UI: Yeah .
UI: And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material .
UI: So probably plastic or something . Uh
PM: Okay .
ID: 
ME: Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice .

PM: Yes .
ME: And um yeah uh
ME: on our website we can see what products we already have .
ME: And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
PM: Okay .
PM: This is It has to be compatible with other things .
PM: Okay .
ME: Yes .
ID: I have one more idea .
ID: Just popped up .
PM: Yes ?
ID: Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries .
ID: So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
PM: No battery use ."
They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device.,"And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip","PM: Okay ,
PM: Roo ,
UI: Yeah .
PM: could you do your presentation ?
UI: Mm-hmm .
UI: Well ,
UI: I don't ha really have much to add ,
UI: um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um
PM: Okay , well
PM: it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
UI: Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume .
UI: Well ,
UI: a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these .
UI: These are both with uh with voice recognition ,
UI: but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape .
PM: Shape .
UI: but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um shape .
UI: So I suggest I couldn't uh
UI: I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper .
UI: But it didn't work .
UI: My pen didn't load um the information .
UI: So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint .
PM: 
UI: So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint .
UI: But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
ID: Mm-hmm .
ID: But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic ,
ID: so that's very good .
PM: Yeah .
PM: And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip
PM: um I mean this is how you hold a remote control .
PM: Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery ,
PM: s because um
ME: Yeah .
ID: Yes .
ID: Slippery .
UI: But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber .
UI: So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed .
ID: You have to grab it .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Yeah , exactly .
PM: Yeah .
ID: Yes .
ID: There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in ,
ID: so you can get a really good grip on it .
ID: So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it .
ID: It's it's a lot easier .
ID: So
ID: m
PM: Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
UI: Yeah .
PM: Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah ,
PM: okay .
ID: Yes .
ID: But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
PM: Okay , good .
ID: 
UI: Great .
ID: 
UI: Oh and um
UI: to add on um Ruud's information ,
UI: in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on ,
UI: and still have the ease of use ,
UI: because we have an easy interface .
UI: And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on .
UI: Yeah .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Way too much I think for our goal ,
PM: yeah .
UI: So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it .
ME: 
ID: 
PM: Okay ,
PM: b but I think we'll
PM: yeah .
UI: So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it ."
The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product.,"Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours ,","PM: Okay um
PM: we have we've about fifteen minutes left ,
PM: so I'm I'm gonna
ID: Oh
ID: we probably have to get going ,
ID: don't we ?
PM: continue with my pres presentation .
PM: Um I've one more slide before we close ,
PM: but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things ,
PM: so I'll just bring that up and show you all
ID: 'Kay .
PM: before we move on . Um
ID: Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours ,
ID: yeah .
UI: Like , to make it different fruits .
ID: 
UI: Yeah , it's possible .
PM: Yeah ,
PM: and then like the the covers could be spongy latex
PM: wherea
PM: but the actual model could be titanium .
ID: Exactly .
ID: And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever .
ID: All these options .
UI: I think maybe th the packaging ,
UI: it should be like a lemon
UI: and the the packaging is like the peel .
UI: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it ,
UI: and the remote control's inside .
ID: Ooh .
ME: Well ,
ME: there we go .
ME: The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun .
ME: It's like the way it all comes all cute .

UI: Don't know .
PM: Ah hmm hmm hmm .
ID: Yeah .
ID: Mm . Options .
ME: Lemons ?"
The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design.,"So presumably that might be an idea to put into .
so maybe we could think about colour ?
so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle ,
What do we think a good size would be for this ?","PM: Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros .
PM: So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy .
ID: Alright
ID: so twenty five .
UI: Mm 'kay .
ID: So yeah ,
ID: I've
ID: The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television ,
ID: and they're fairly basic .
ID: So uh
PM: Yeah . Yeah .
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: Yeah , I was thinking that as well ,
PM: I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things
PM: where they're ,
PM: yeah .
PM: So presumably that might be an idea to put into .
UI: Yeah the universal ones . Yeah .
ID: Mm .
ID: But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .
PM: So presumably that might be an idea to put into .
ME: Slim .
UI: Yeah .
PM: Yeah , yeah .
PM: Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ?
UI: Mm-hmm , it's about that .
PM: And that's quite a lot for a remote control .
ID: Yeah , yeah .
UI: Mm .
UI: Um well
UI: my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black .
UI: As you said they come with the T V
UI: so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions ,
UI: so maybe we could think about colour ?
UI: Make
UI: that might make it a bit different from the rest at least .
UI: Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick ,
UI: so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle ,
UI: you know those things ?
ME: 
PM: Uh-huh .
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: Okay .
PM: The the keyrings , yeah yeah .
PM: Okay ,
PM: that's cool .
UI: Because we always lose our remote control .
ID: Right .
ME: and apart from this , it should be having a good look also ,
ME: because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C D player , M P three player like any electronic devices .
ME: They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands ,
ME: so , yes ,
ME: all this .
UI: Mm .
UI: Mm-hmm .
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: 
UI: Yeah .
PM: Okay .
PM: 'Kay .
ID: Uh , what do we think a
PM: So ,
PM: we're looking for
PM: 'Kay .
PM: We're
ID: What do we think a good size would be for this ?
ME: 
PM: Sorry ,
PM: carry on .
UI: 
ID: 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky
ID: and there's just like a hundred buttons on it ,
ID: or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .
UI: Yeah .
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: Mm-hmm .
UI: Yeah .
UI: Then you lose it , yeah .
UI: Kind of um , maybe more like a P D A kind of , just hand held ,
UI: like ,
UI: 'cause
PM: Okay .
PM: For for uh
PM: remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .

The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget.,"Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro ,

"The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion.","Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .
They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative ,
and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use .
Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important ,
is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative ,
which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials ,","ME: Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls .

ME: um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .

We look at the age group of forty plus .
Uh no , younger than forty .

It's a new requirement .
Yeah but we don't use it .
No discussion about it .","ID: Yeah . I have uh one question .
ID: If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L C D or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher .

ID: Like
ME: Yes .

ME: Wait ,
ME: is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?
PM: Kind of .
UI: Except the entire screen .
ID: It's the entire screen is just running information at random .
ID: Seemingly .
PM: Yeah it's the whole screen .
UI: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,
UI: you know it's like
PM: So anyway
ME: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?
PM: Right .
PM: Right .
PM: But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .
PM: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,
PM: and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so
PM: Those are our new product requirements .
PM: Alright . Mm-hmm .
UI: Yeah .
ME: Okay .
ID: Okay .
ID: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?
PM: Yes .
PM: It's part of the logo .
PM: Okay .
UI: Company colour being yellow ."

"The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device, and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal.","and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands .
And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals .
Um too much metal is used sometimes
and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire
just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad .
Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .
Um , components . Just some ideas that I had ,
um , energy source ,
it's kinda hip to be eco friendly
so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup .
Um the user interface ,
since we can't use metal
I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic .
The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that ,
Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared
'cause it is the industry standard ,
Uh PAL and N T S C compatible
and uh probably a two hundred foot range .
Um personal preferences ,
I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal ,
which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value ,
Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics
that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value

The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting.,"the minutes from the last time .
Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything

we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition ,
we've decided on there being a flip design
and um a different shape from what's normal .
We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines ,
and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost ,","PM: I'll wait until you're all um hooked up .

PM: Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing ,
PM: and who we all are and stuff like that ,
PM: mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .
ME: 
ME: 
PM: Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
PM: now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T V remote and stuff
PM: and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R and D for that ,
PM: that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before ,
PM: see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today .
PM: Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations ,
PM: whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
ME: Mm-hmm .
UI: 
ME: 
UI: Hmm .
UI: Do you have any preference uh of order ?
PM: Um I'd like to um hear
PM: o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first .
PM: I want
PM: what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
ME: 
ID: 
ME: Batteries .
UI: I think she is still finishing her .
ID: No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .
PM: It's just that
PM: yeah , let's let's hear from you first .
UI: Hmm .
ID: Okay ."
The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one.,I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .,"PM: Thank you very much .
PM: That was that was great .
PM: Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects .
PM: Was that you ?
PM: Great .
ID: Mm 'kay .
ME: Hmm .
ME: Yeah ,
ME: have I unscrewed it ?
PM: Push .
PM: User interface ,
PM: right .
PM: Interface .
ME: Here we go .
UI: Cheers .
ME: Mm-hmm .
ME: And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .
PM: Mm 'kay ,
PM: thank you .
ID: Okay ,
ID: great .
ME: 
PM: Okay .
UI: Here we go .
UI: So
UI: I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls .
UI: In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them ,
UI: uh what things do they get right ,
UI: what's bad about them ,
UI: what's wrong with 'em ,
UI: um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found
UI: and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .
UI: Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum .
UI: Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control ,
UI: so it's one that's got lots of buttons ,
UI: it's it's fully featured ,
UI: everything you might possibly want to do is there ,
UI: you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: it's it's fully featured
UI: and it might take a while to get to learn to use it ,
UI: but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T V .
PM: 
ID: 
UI: The one on the right is a lot more basic .
UI: It's just got the essential functions of the T V changing the channel , play , stop , volume .
UI: It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it ,
UI: but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts .
UI: There are disadvantages ,
UI: you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture .
UI: Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control .
UI: So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two .
PM: Mm 'kay .
PM: Thank you very much .
PM: That was very useful .
PM: It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . Um .
ID: Hmm .
PM: And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?
ME: No .
UI: 
ID: Yeah .
ID: I think that could be our selling point .
PM: Mm .
ME: A fashion fashion remote .
UI: I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool .
UI: And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress .
ID: Right .
PM: Mm .
ME: Mm-hmm ."
The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote.,"we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting .
discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T V a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well .
Um it's come to my attention the following .
Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet .
Remote control should only be used for the T V . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues .
Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable ,
um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there .
Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .
to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing .
Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so .
Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first ,","ME: Just put it on the deskt desktop .
PM: No
PM: on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link .
PM: A
PM: well
PM: actually just there .
PM: Yeah . That's it .
PM: If you dump it in there .
ME: Project documents ,
ME: yeah .
ME: What's your username ?
PM: Your username .
ME: What's your username and password ?
ME: Mm-hmm .
ME: Sorry .
ME: Okay .
ME: There we go .
PM: Okay .
PM: Excellent .
PM: Right .
PM: Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go .
PM: So .
PM: Functional design meeting .
PM: We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um
PM: we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting .
PM: Not a lot thankfully to say .
PM: We introduced ourselves ,
PM: discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T V a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well .

PM: Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable ,
PM: um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there .
PM: Um . Now .
PM: Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required .
PM: Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use .
PM: So
PM: to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing .
PM: Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so .
PM: Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going .
PM: Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first ,
PM: to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go .
PM: So um
PM: I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want .
ME: 'Kay .
ME: Sure .
ME: Um , sh would you like to
ME: I'll just do it from here .
PM: Yep .
PM: Sorry .
PM: Uh . Is yours the

PM: that's right ,
PM: I mean
PM: th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity ,
PM: I mean
PM: I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows .
PM: Um I won't comment on leadership ,
PM: uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together .
PM: Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens ,
PM: uh I think the results speak for itself
PM: and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
ID: Mm . Yeah , definitely .
UI: Yeah .
ID: Mm-hmm .
ID: Mm .
UI: Yeah .
ID: Yep .
PM: uh a new approach .
PM: Um are the costs within budget ?
PM: Yes .
PM: Is the project evaluated ?
PM: We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um
ID: Yep ."
The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one.,"But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R C is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .","PM: Um the individual presentations ,
PM: I th
PM: um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
UI: Yeah , I'll start .
PM: Uh uh yeah . Okay ,
PM: great .
ID: Yes .
UI: Um Oh ,
UI: how can I uh
UI: Geez ,
UI: and sli and show .
UI: Um Just uh press it .
PM: 
UI: Um Just uh press it .
UI: Uh yes .
UI: Alright . Um well
UI: w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion .
UI: Uh the method of the remote control is just
UI: the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
UI: So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do .
UI: Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls ,
UI: the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion .
UI: And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Mm-hmm .
PM: Yeah .
UI: Um but um yeah .
UI: My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control ,
UI: because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design .
UI: But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old .
UI: So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design .
UI: But it should b I think it should be a combination ,
UI: but teletext buttons are not uh in our design .
UI: So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .
PM: Uh-huh .
UI: So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so .
UI: But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R C is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
PM: Okay .
PM: Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
ME: Yeah , uh b uh most .
UI: Yeah .
PM: Okay , so
PM: the important thing here is
ME: 
UI: And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: what what does the market want ?
UI: I I don't know .
ME: Oh ,
ME: user-friendly .
PM: In the market ,
PM: yeah .
PM: Yeah , okay ,
PM: w we will s we all uh
UI: Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Okay ."
The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design.,because I think uh we have a prototype now,"PM: Well
PM: but that's also useful for the evaluation ,
PM: because I think uh we have a prototype now
PM: which we can afford
PM: and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
ME: Evaluation drops .
PM: design . Doodle .
PM: And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
ME: And erase the mic .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: goodbye mic .
ID: All I need is no mic .
ME: 
UI: 
ID: 
PM: Let's see ,
PM: we can save this now .
UI: Oh ,
UI: I already erased half of the line .
ID: Bon chance
PM: And move back to here .
UI: Too bad , oh .
PM: 
ID: 
ME: 
UI: Like this ?
PM: Mm-hmm .
UI: Still looks nice .
PM: And then all green .
PM: Okay , well
PM: thank you .
UI: Oh ,
UI: that's erase .
ME: Looks like a iPod .
PM: Oh ,
PM: no .
ID: No ,
ID: add
PM: Hey ,
PM: but you can erase that .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: that's a bit weird .
UI: Oh ,
UI: now I'm line .
ID: Yeah .
PM: Uh-oh .
ID: S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
UI: Yeah .
ME: Oh .
ME: All I need is mic .
PM: Right .
PM: And you can't erase this ?
PM: Hmm , strange .
PM: Okay , well uh
PM: just leave it at this
PM: and quickly save .
PM: Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation .
PM: We just did our project evaluation .
PM: Um well ,
PM: I think I can sit for that
PM: since it's almost my final slide . Um

"The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition, interchangeable cases, visible light, and a soft casing material.","Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ?

we didn't quite have enough material uh .
as you can see this is just a most superficial layer
and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like
Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips
and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that .
we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials
We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .
It's not it's not quite a a face plate ,
it's more like a pseudo-face plate

UI: Yeah mm .
ID: That was good .
ME: This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
UI: Mm .
UI: Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay .
UI: Good job good job .
ID: Yeah .
ID: 
PM: Mm-hmm .
ME: And the leadership was excellent .
ID: 
PM: Yeah I think so .
PM: He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .
ID: 
ID: Fine yes uh
ME: Yeah that's right .
ME: Yeah that's right .
PM: Uh the teamwork was very very good .
PM: I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you .
ID: Very democratic .

PM: I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you .
PM: Oh .
ID: Thank you .
ME: 
UI: Thank you .
ID: Alright .
UI: Alright .
ME: And new ideas found .
ME: Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?
UI: Mm .
ID: Come up with new product .
ME: I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ?
PM: Less fancy .
UI: Mm we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings .
ID: Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting
ID: uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that ,
ID: but I think it's alright .
ME: 
UI: Mm .
ID: but I think it's alright .
ID: We achieved uh project goal I think .

um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .","PM: Um s right so um
PM: just to close up ,
PM: I'm not sure how much time I've used
PM: mm next time right Project Manager , sorted .
PM: Um .
PM: Is
PM: uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so
PM: um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .
PM: Um U I D well yeah you right g your assignments are up there
PM: and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do .
PM: Um mm basic and um so
PM: I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want .
PM: So
PM: actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have ,
PM: you know like uh so
ME: What they're looking for .
ME: And negotiate that . Uh .
PM: yeah well it is
PM: and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between
PM: um so yeah
PM: specific instructions will be sent in your email .
PM: But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um
PM: and as more things come up we'll have meetings
PM: and you'll get emails and so forth ."
The project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member.,"This is our agenda .
Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .
then I can take some notes
Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .
but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down .
Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control .
It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through .
First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings .
After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design .
Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .
And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation .
But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .","PM: Well
PM: I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction .
PM: Uh it's a company in uh electronics .
PM: We put fashion in electronics ,
PM: uh we make it work ,
PM: uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself .
PM: I'm Bart the project manager
PM: so I'll direct you through the project .
PM: This is our agenda .
PM: Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .

PM: Uh maybe I can sit down ,
PM: then I can take some notes
PM: or
PM: Let's see .
ME: Sure .
PM: Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while .
PM: I dunno it's not a lot of work ,
PM: but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down .
PM: Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training .
PM: Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit .
PM: I can see if it works this way .
ID: 
UI: 
ME: Oh yeah .
UI: Okay . Yeah .
PM: I can see if it works this way .
PM: No , it doesn't work here .
PM: Okay no problem .
PM: Um okay ,
PM: what are we going to do ?
PM: Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control .
PM: It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
PM: So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you .
PM: We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look .
PM: And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original .
ME: Okay .
PM: And we've got our User Interface Designer .
PM: He's also uh
UI: Yep .
PM: That's about the new remote control .
PM: Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through .
PM: First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings .
PM: After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
PM: I had some role indications on here .
PM: But I think you know it already by yourself .
PM: The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design .
PM: Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design .

UI: so
UI: I'll be working on the design .
PM: Right

ID: and uh
ID: yeah .
PM: Yep ,
PM: good .
PM: Okay ,
PM: very very quickly , um this
PM: I don't want to make this meeting too structured
PM: because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank .
PM: Everybody says what they what they want to say ,
PM: uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else
PM: um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do .
PM: The the remote control needs to be original ,
PM: there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have
PM: so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different ,
PM: uh I want one ,
PM: um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario .
PM: User-friendly
PM: as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly
PM: so we want to make ours one that people can pick up
PM: and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works ,
PM: uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that
PM: I may not need another remote control
PM: but uh it's such a nice one
PM: I'm gonna have one .
PM: And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money ,
PM: and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .
ME: 
PM: The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do ,
PM: the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer
PM: and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .
PM: Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board
PM: and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um
PM: In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um"
"The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design, and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design.","what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being
until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .","ID: So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined
ID: and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation ,
ID: and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .
ME: 
PM: 
PM: 
UI: Mm-hmm .
ID: A customisable and
UI: 
ME: Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case .

PM: Yes .
PM: Yes .
PM: Don't looks nice uh .
PM: Yeah , so uh
PM: what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being
PM: until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display .
PM: Okay . So
PM: maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model .
PM: Okay ?
UI: Mm-hmm .
UI: Okay .
UI: Sure .
PM: 
UI: 
ID: So um
ID: are we done with this meeting ?
PM: 
PM: Yeah , I hope ,
PM: if
PM: is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay .
PM: Then they can show you how it looks like ,
PM: and then we can uh submit to the
PM: I will submit to the management .
PM: Okay ?
PM: Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display .
PM: An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .
ID: 
ID: And a marketing strategy .
ME: And marketing strategy , thank you .
ME: Fired .

ID: 
UI: 
PM: Yes .
PM: How much you can
PM: how mu how much how much you can sell extra .

ID: 
PM: Of course you'll make money too ,
PM: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission .
ME: 
UI: 
PM: so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission .
UI: 
ME: 
PM: Okay , so , any questions ?
UI: No .
PM: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay ,
PM: then uh , then we can proceed from there .
UI: Okay .
UI: Mm-hmm .
PM: It's okay ?
PM: So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then .
PM: Okay ?

PM: Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly ,
PM: so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
PM: The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such .
PM: There's the functional design of the the remote control .
PM: We're going
PM: the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially
PM: and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
PM: Um similarly with the conceptual design ,
PM: we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops
PM: and then we'll bring what we've done together .
PM: Um and then the detailed design will come after that .
PM: We'll pull it all together .
ID: I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ?
ID: Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?
PM: I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be
PM: we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control
PM: and what what specific things it it has to do
PM: but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that
PM: and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .
ID: Right .
ID: 
ID: How how it will be done .
ID: So
ID: whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ?
ID: Uh
ID: I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the

PM: yeah .
ID: Okay .
PM: Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself .
PM: Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project ,

ID: Um
ME: Mm .
PM: Yeah .
ID: We want to have a
ID: no , I don't know if this is a good idea .

ID: Yeah yeah .
ID: Yeah .

The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices.,"Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit .
and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five .
If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .
that was profiting ,","PM: Right .
PM: This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing .
PM: Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance .
PM: So ,
PM: the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control ,
PM: as you probably all know .
PM: The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly .
PM: Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that ,
PM: but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design .
PM: Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway ,
PM: so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart .
PM: This is how today seems to be going to work .
PM: We're gonna have the three kay phases ,
PM: as you've probably already been told ,
PM: the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um
PM: First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design .
PM: Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials ,
PM: and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far .
PM: Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe ,
PM: right .
ME: Oh . Oh oh
ME: I think you ga
PM: Oh , um ,
PM: you can clip them to your belt .
ID: Do we take them off ?

ID: Now
ID: where do I put the
ME: Just um somewhere
PM: Yep ,
PM: the , it's just across there ,
PM: that's it .
PM: Yep .
ID: Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?
ME: I think so .
PM: Yeah .
PM: It'll follow you
PM: if you
ME: Yeah . There you go .
PM: You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now ,
PM: I wouldn't worry too much .
PM: Should have good range .

PM: so ,
PM: on to it .
PM: Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit .

so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .
Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech .

Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television ,
so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control ,
Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert ,
uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older ,
but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty .
I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now

The speech interface

And the lighting adaptation
and the teletext .
And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions .
If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes .

ID: Because if
UI: Using the T V to access the internet ? Or what ?

um , trendy ,
appealing to a wide market ,
and user-friendly ,
grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .","PM: 
UI: Hmm hmm hmm .
PM: Are we
PM: we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?
UI: Yeah .
PM: Okay , that's fine .
PM: Am I supposed to be standing up there ?

PM: grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it .
PM: Okay , um , first is the functional design ,
PM: um this is where we all go off and do our individual work ,
PM: um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product ,
PM: um what effects the product has to have
PM: and how it's actually going to do that .
PM: Um , conceptual design ,
PM: what we're thinking ,

"It can be used as a normal remote, but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface.","A a and the voice recognition as well ,
it's it's it's another approach ,","UI: That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button .
UI: But uh we don't uh we don't uh
UI: we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
ID: Like this one .
ID: It's important .
ID: Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve .
ID: Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control .
ID: And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions ,
ID: and then they will not use this dial as often .
ID: But other users who are new to this device need something like that .
ID: They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume ,
ID: so it's easier for them
PM: Okay .
PM: Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?
ID: Yeah , maybe so . Yes ,
ID: it's
PM: A a and the voice recognition as well ,
PM: th maybe you could uh could uh
ID: Well ,
ID: it's it's it's another approach ,
ID: it's more that our um .
ID: There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device .
ID: It's it's quite easy .
PM: 
PM: Yeah .
PM: Okay . Okay ,
PM: good .
PM: And and the case is is rubber ?
ID: Yes , rubber ?
PM: And the buttons ?
UI: Plastic or rubber .

UI: yeah .
ID: There are plastic or rubber .
PM: Okay ,
PM: and uh the colouring ?
ID: Uh yellow with uh
PM: with with grey or black .
ID: grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least .
PM: Okay ,
PM: we'll we'll come to that later . Um
UI: 
ID: 
PM: okay .
PM: Anything else to add
PM: or
ID: No .
ID: Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons .
ID: But
PM: Yeah .
ME: Well ,
ME: you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button ,
ME: 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels .
ID: Yes ,
ID: but it
ID: but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think .
ID: Or not ?
PM: M uh
PM: yeah .
PM: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
ME: You
ID: Well
ID: okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .
UI: And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
PM: Yeah
PM: al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and
PM: but o okay ,
PM: that that's not really really important .
ID: Yes .
UI: Yeah .

PM: 
ME: I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .
ID: 
ME: For marketing .
ME: Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan .
ME: In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays .
ME: Findings .
ME: Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following .
ME: At first , the colours of fruit .
PM: 
ME: Very basic colours , like Janus explained .
ME: Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow .
ME: Um , considering material , um
PM: 
ME: 
ME: Yeah . They like spongy material ,
ME: like yeah a sponge-ball .

ID: Well , the Teletubbies sh
PM: 
ME: Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh .
ME: It's nice , I think .
PM: Flashy .
PM: Yeah .
ME: Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours .
ME: Uh
ME: Yeah , uh materials like wood that
PM: Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of .
ID: Well , you could . You you could .
ME: No n j just j just a w
PM: Yeah but never seen one .
UI: It'll float .
ME: No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look .
PM: Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah .
ID: Yeah .
ME: Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor .
ME: The that isn't wood anyway , but
ME: Okay ?
UI: Tables .
PM: Okay .
ID: 
ME: But , that's our secondary audience .
ME: So , uh we decided to take
PM: Yeah .
ME: mm yeah the people below forty .
ME: So , that this doesn't apply .
PM: Yeah .
ME: 'Kay , the third .
ME: Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls .
ME: They have to look fancy .
ME: Um , they should be technological in innovative .
ME: That means uh there have to be fancy things in .
ME: Uh , and easy to use .
ME: But that's common ."
The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison.,"And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .
you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way ,
keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum ,
um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T V .
or do we need to have like functions for cable or V C R ?
I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring ,
And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .","UI: And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way .

UI: uh
UI: or um maybe that making 'em the same colour ,
UI: keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum ,
UI: and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough
UI: I'm not sure we c
UI: I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing ,
UI: um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T V .
UI: Does it have like capacity to change the channels ?
UI: Um does it do
UI: or do we need to have like functions for cable or V C R ?
UI: And then , is it findable ,
UI: and uh how do we wanna do that ?
UI: And um
UI: I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring ,
UI: um I dunno if this will work but
UI: And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .

The project manager closed the meeting.,"Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .
so we will go back to our own uh work .
Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes
and um , well , you know your o your individual actions
or your personal coach will probably email you about th it .
See you in thirty minutes .","ID: Well ,
ID: I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords .
ID: You know these things .
ID: And um it's very easy for a user to to switch
ID: w yes ,
ID: to to switch b uh between uh channels
ID: or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C D ,
ID: on on a chapters , you know , on a D V D player .
ID: So maybe that's an idea ,
ID: I don't know .
UI: But
UI: Yeah .
PM: Uh-huh .
UI: They're very vu vulnerable .
UI: Yeah .
UI: Yeah .
UI: And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing .
UI: Uh point at a T V , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T V ,
UI: so you must point everywhere ,
UI: so maybe infrared is
ID: Mm-hmm .
ID: Okay .
PM: Maybe not even pointed .
PM: Yeah .
UI: Yeah , just don't even point it ,
UI: so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .
ID: Mm-hmm .
ID: Uh is that uh
ID: are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ?
ID: So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
PM: Okay
PM: Uh
UI: Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah .
UI: For T V , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T V ,
UI: so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that ,
UI: but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh
UI: You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um
UI: you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons ,
UI: so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand .
UI: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think .
UI: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are ,
UI: so it should be visible al um in dark too .
UI: So when it's dark
PM: Okay , s yeah .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Okay .
UI: Those are two really uh user interface
PM: 
PM: Uh I'll write down glow in the dark .
PM: Okay , um
PM: I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now .
PM: Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily
PM: um or it should not consume too much um power .
PM: Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .
PM: Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time .
PM: Um
UI: It's over ?
ID: Okay .
ME: 
ID: Okay .
PM: so we will go back to our own uh work .

"The industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources, casing, case supplements, buttons, and chips.","About the components design .
Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery

But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete .
So I don't think it's really an option .
Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing .
It's really up the the design that we're gonna use .
Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .
Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber .
And the chip-set , um it says simple here ,
but it should be advanced ,
because we're using an L C D uh screen .
And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood ,
but it raises the price
and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines .

And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T V , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan .","ID: 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is ,
ID: so in that sense
ID: so it does kind of make sense , yeah .
ME: Yeah .
PM: Okay .
ME: Yeah , sure .
ME: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it ,

PM: and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end .
PM: That might be a better idea this time .
PM: And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David ,
PM: if that's alright .
PM: Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right .

PM: We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ?
PM: Right .
PM: Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product .

we don't have to use metal ,
and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic ,
I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything .
They're kind of moulded

PM: Sure .
UI: Um .

UI: but
PM: 
UI: I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions .
UI: So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised ,
UI: or can it be altered in a certain way ,
UI: or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .
PM: Mm .
PM: Right .
PM: Right .
ME: Yeah ,
ME: like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options .
ME: So that way the remote reads it .
UI: Right ,
UI: so it's got like a limited memory and programme it .

ID: Well , we are making the chip .

The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype.,"So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls .
And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple .
So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,

UI: And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .
PM: Yeah .
UI: Um . So .
PM: And also does it uh fit well in hand ?
PM: Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .
UI: Yeah .
UI: Well this these uh these remotes are quite big ,
UI: so go to the next page ,
UI: so .
UI: We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .
PM: Yeah .
ID: Yeah .
PM: Yeah .
UI: So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part ,
UI: and on the left one is exactly the same .
UI: So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power ,
UI: yeah ?
UI: These are the basic thing .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Yeah .
PM: So it's only the central part .

PM: Yeah .
PM: With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
UI: Yeah ,
UI: if you have , for example
UI: I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .
UI: It could be on the right side , for example .
UI: Yeah .
UI: Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have .
PM: Yeah .
PM: Okay .
UI: And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
PM: Okay .
UI: you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .
UI: Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .
PM: Okay . S
PM: Okay .
PM: Will be down or
PM: Okay .
UI: So that they're separate a bit ,
UI: yeah .
UI: Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either .

The user interface designer discussed the technical functions of a remote and indicated that a user centered approach to designing the interface would be preferable.,"Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set ,

You can see they are very different .
The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera .

Uh what are your experiences with remote controls .
Big one , they are uh not easy to use .
And uh g big buttons ,
m uh that's easier to use than uh I think .
Big buttons , positive .
Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T V set .
And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote .
And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .

ME: So we n barely used it .
PM: Okay so they have too much ."
"The project manager opens the meeting, stating that it is about conceptual design.","So today is um our third meeting .

PM: If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings
PM: um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons
PM: and we are not decided about u the use of L C D screen on on the remote control because of costs .
PM: So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today .
PM: Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
PM: So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us .

UI: I is there a matter for a new remote control ?
PM: Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs ."
The project manager then went over the project budget.,"the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .
Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,
we uh we will focus this internationally ,
And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty ,","PM: Um okay ,
PM: back to our project .
PM: Um
PM: the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros .
PM: Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,
ID: 
UI: 
ME: 
PM: which is quite a number .
PM: Um
PM: we uh we will focus this internationally ,
PM: so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country .
PM: And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty ,
PM: so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development ,
PM: um
PM: because uh , well , those are important numbers ."
"The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device, which totaled 11.9 Euros.","Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .
Um the only one that's in there , production costs .
But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed
I said uncurved or flat .
My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
There's plastic for that area around the button .
Um and lots of special colours actually .
Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine ,
which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .","PM: Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .
PM: Um the only one that's in there , production costs .
PM: And if you open it up .
PM: Um I've just stuck the numbers in ,
PM: it was a real challenge there .
PM: But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed
PM: I mean , we decided on batteries ,
PM: and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button .
PM: Um
ID: 
PM: I said uncurved or flat .
PM: I think that's what you have there ,
PM: is that right ?
PM: For the for the plastic part would be
ID: My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
ID: But it's really not very clear ,
ID: because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means .
ID: One side is curved and then the other side is curved .
PM: Oh . Okay .
PM: Right .
PM: Well yeah .
PM: If we're talking about the area just
PM: oh I d
PM: I dunno .
PM: I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see .
PM: Um so what else ?
PM: There's plastic for that area around the button .
PM: Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ?
PM: Um and lots of special colours actually .
PM: Uh scroll wheel .
PM: Do you see anything that I've missed ?
ID: 
ME: 
ID: Mm-hmm .
ID: No
ID: I think that's alright .
PM: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine ,
PM: which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit .
PM: And if we sold a lot of squishy things .
PM: Boo yeah .
ID: 
UI: Mm ."
After that they briefly discuss finances.,"so another important part of the project is about money ,","PM: So
PM: so another important part of the project is about money ,
PM: uh and about
PM: so about finances .
PM: So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control
PM: and uh we have um
PM: which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay .
PM: And we should target the inter an international market .
UI: So could I just ask one question , um
UI: is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ?
UI: So it's gonna be you already have a T V but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?
PM: O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly ,
PM: so let's go to it .
UI: Okay , alright .
PM: So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go .
PM: Should be should
PM: should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ?
PM: Should it be a universal one ?
PM: And uh etcetera .
PM: So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly
PM: because we have only three three minutes to go .
UI: Okay well ,
UI: so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make ,
UI: which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet ,
UI: but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket
UI: so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for
UI: um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro
UI: because it seems quite a lot for a remote control ,
UI: so it's
PM: Okay .
PM: Okay I think this is more a job to our
PM: market person yeah .
PM: So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .
ID: Marketing person .
UI: Yeah .
ID: Mm-hmm ."
